## Folder Structure

Root Directory: The main folder of your project with an overarching name, e.g., pi-zero2w-project.

src/: The source code for your program. This is where you place all your main code, organized by functionality (e.g., camera/, gpio/, audio/, api/).

tests/: A dedicated folder for unit tests or any other automated tests. This keeps your testing separate but easily accessible.

scripts/: Place helper scripts or utilities here, such as setup scripts, build scripts, or any other tooling that isn't directly part of your main program logic.

docs/: Documentation for your project. This could include a README, user guides, architecture overviews, or API documentation.

config/: Any configuration files, like settings or environment variables, which your program needs. You can split by environment (e.g., config/development/, config/production/).

assets/: Store non-code assets such as images, audio files, or any other media that your program uses.

examples/: If you want to provide example usages or demonstration scripts for others to understand how to use your code.

requirements.txt or Pipfile: If using Python, include dependency management files.
